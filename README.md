This will demonstrate the basic functionality of the system, including retrieving context for a query and adding new documents in real-time.

## Extending the System

You can extend this system by:
- Implementing more advanced text preprocessing
- Using more sophisticated embedding techniques (e.g., word2vec, BERT)
- Adding support for different types of documents or data sources
- Implementing a REST API for easy integration with other systems
